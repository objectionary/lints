# @todo #624:60min Enable `catches-inconsistency-in-nested-anonymous-formations` test story.
#  For now, its disabled because `LtInconsistentArgs` fails to convert parent tree with anonymous
#  objects to searchable XPath for the XMIR. We should change our logic in both
#  `LtInconsistentArgs#voidFqn()` and `VoidXpath`. Don't forget to enable
#  `catches-inconsistency-resolving-anonymous-path.yaml`,
#  `catches-inconsistency-when-parent-object-lacks-name.yaml`, and test stories as well.
