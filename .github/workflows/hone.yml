    #  At present, the hone is unable to generate the correct optimized byte code for Groovy, see
    #  this issue: https://github.com/objectionary/hone-maven-plugin/issues/297. Also, the plugin run
    #  is time-consuming, we should enable it only after the plugin will have stable execution time,
    #  in order to not disturb the development in this repository.
